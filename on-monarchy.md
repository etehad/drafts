# On Monarchy

It's a surprise to me that so many people are actually on board with the idea of another monarchy, even if only ceremonial. The main problem here is how many millions of other Iranians feel about the Pahlavi dynasty and monarchies in general. There's a chance that we can get supporters of the Islamic Republic onboard with the idea of democracy, but there's no way we can reach a consensus if we're talking about a monarchy, at least not in the near future or without bloodshed. If we're going to have a ceremonial monarchy, we might just as well have a ceremonial theocracy too!

In case you're wondering why we care about supporters of the Islamic Republic, well, there are millions of them. And I strongly believe (based on some evidence) that majority of them don't have an issue with a democracy or might even prefer it. They will not risk their life for it, but will accept it with open arms if given to them peacefully.

Remember, love is wise and hatred is foolish. If we want freedom and a stable democracy, we have to get as many people on board as we can, which requires a lot of comprise and mutual understanding. I see no future if we stay divided.
